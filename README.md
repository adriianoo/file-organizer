#  file organizer
 
This script was initially written to organize my download-folder.<br>
It creates folders and stores the appropriate files in there.<br>
I used [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html) for the operations.

<br />

You can run the script with:
```
python -u "your_pathname\main.py"
```
